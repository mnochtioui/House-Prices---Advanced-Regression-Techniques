## Introduction

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide to tackling the Kaggle House Prices challenge. It walks you through the entire data science process, from data cleaning to predictive modeling. The goal is to predict house prices based on various features.

## Project Overview

The project is structured to help you understand each step involved in building a predictive model. You will learn how to:

- Clean and preprocess data.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns.
- Engineer new features to improve model performance.
- Implement regression models to make predictions.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies, including:

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **LightGBM**: A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning tools.

## Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is crucial for any data science project. In this section, we focus on:

- Handling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Correcting data types.

The cleaning process ensures that the data is in the best shape for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helps in understanding the dataset. We visualize relationships and distributions to uncover insights. Key steps include:

- Visualizing distributions of numerical features.
- Analyzing correlations between features.
- Identifying outliers.

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering enhances model performance by creating new features. This section covers:

- Creating interaction terms.
- Encoding categorical variables.
- Normalizing numerical features.

These steps aim to improve the predictive power of the model.

## Regression Modeling

Regression modeling is the core of this project. We explore various regression techniques, including:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- LightGBM

Each model is evaluated based on performance metrics like RMSE and R¬≤.

## Results

The final model's performance is assessed using the Kaggle leaderboard. The project aims for high accuracy in predicting house prices, providing insights into which features matter most.
